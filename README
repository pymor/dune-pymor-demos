dune-pymor-demos is a git supermodule which serves as a demonstration module
for dune-pymor (https://github.com/pyMor/dune-pymor). This module provides
the correct versions of all relevant DUNE (http://www.dune-project.org)
modules and of pyMor (http://www.pymor.org) as git submodules. It also
provides a git submodule located in local/bin which containes some helper
scripts to download and build the demos.

To get started, clone this repository and call 'git submodule update', i.e.:

    git clone https://github.com/pyMor/dune-pymor-demos.git
    cd dune-pymor-demos
    git submodue update --init

You can now check if one of the config.opts.?? files is named after a compiler
that is available on your system. If not, copy an existing file and edit it
accordingly (mainly CC, CXX and F77), i.e.:

    cp config.opts.gcc config.opts.mycppcompiler

Please note that DUNE in general is known to work best with gcc. dune-pymor
is tested to work with gcc-4.6 and clang-3.1-8. You can now set the CC
environment variable to match your compiler and generate a PATH.sh file, i.e.:

    CC=gcc ./local/bin/gen_path.py
    source PATH.sh

It is convenient to source this PATH.sh file from now on whenever you want to
work on dune-pymor, since many of the provided scripts require the CC variable
to be set correctly.
