dune-pymor-demos is a git supermodule which serves as a demonstration module
for dune-pymor (https://github.com/pyMor/dune-pymor). This module provides
the correct versions of all relevant DUNE (http://www.dune-project.org)
modules and of pyMor (http://www.pymor.org) as git submodules. It also
provides a git submodule located in local/bin which containes some helper
scripts to download and build the demos.

To get started, clone this repository and call 'git submodule update', i.e.:

    git clone https://github.com/pyMor/dune-pymor-demos.git
    cd dune-pymor-demos
    git submodue update --init

You can now have a look at the config.opts.?? files if one of them is
named after compiler that is available on your system. IF not, copy an
existing file and edit it accordingly, i.e.:

    cp config.opts.gcc config.opts.mycppcompiler

You can now set the CC environment variable to your compiler and generate
a PATH.sh file, i.e.:

    CC=gcc ./local/bin/gen_path.py
    source PATH.sh

It is convenient to source this file from now on, whenever you want to work
on dune-pymor, since many of the provided scripts require the CC variable to
be set correctly.
